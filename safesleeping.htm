          <p>
		AAP recommendations on creating a safe sleep environment include:
 <ul>
    <li>Place the baby on his or her back on a firm sleep surface such as a crib or bassinet with a tight-fitting sheet.</li>
    <li>Avoid use of soft bedding, including crib bumpers, blankets, pillows and soft toys. </li>
    <li>The crib should be bare.</li>
    <li> Room-sharing decreases the risk of SIDS by as much as 50 percent.</li>
    <li>Avoid baby's exposure to smoke, alcohol and illicit drugs.</li>
</ul>

		<p> You want to remember not to over bundle up your baby. Above is a picture of my 4 month old baby sleeping
			in a light sleeper in a room that is 68 degrees. 
			Babies are not good at self regulating their body temperatures. So it is very important 
			to monitor the temperature of the room.
			There are many ways to know if your baby is too hot including: 
			<ol> 
				<li> Baby monitors</li>
				<li> Room Thermometors</li>
				<li> looking for signs of over heating in baby. </li>
						<ul>  
							<li> Damp hair  </li>
							<li> Warm tummy   </li>
							<li>  flushed cheeks              </li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
		   It is a good practice to only swaddle your baby until they can roll from from to back. My newborn
			figured out she could roll around 3 months old. It will be different for every baby.
 		   Babies under a year are not advised to have a blanket. If you are afraid baby is cold you can
                   dress baby with a wearable blanket or sleep sack.
