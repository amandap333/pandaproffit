Always allow enough time for your baby to have tummy time every day. 
Tummy time is crucial. Since the back to sleep campaign in 1994, 
babies don't spend as much time on their tummies to strengthen those muscles. 
Allowing tummy time every day will make your baby happier overall because
it will strengthen those muscles allowing your baby to reach those milestones!
