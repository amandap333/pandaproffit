			<h2> The First Night Home</h2>
			<p>  That first night home may seem so scary. Who let you take this baby home? What if they don't sleep?
			     Why didn't I take more of those parenting courses? Don't worry. It'll be okay. Here are the basics: 
			     <ol>
				<li>Newborns sleep a lot, about 16 hours a day. Make sure you always put baby to sleep on their backs.</li>
				<li>Newborns need to eat every 2-3 hours.</li>
				<li>Newborns will have a startle reflex at night. Don't freakout, it's normal! </li>
				<li>You'll change a lot of diapers. Make sure your baby has atleast 6 wet diapers a day. </li>
				<li>If you have fed, and changed baby and they still won't sleep, try gently burping the baby. </li>
				<li>You can start tummy time the first night home!</li>
			     </ol>
				<div> Most importantly just know you're doing a great job and enjoy your new baby! </div> <!-- added div tag in text tag -->

			<h2> Carseat Safety </h2>
			<image src= "carseat.jpg" alt="carseat" />
			<p>  <strong>&#8226;It is important to make sure you have your new baby buckled in safety.</strong>
			     <ul>
				<li> Do the "pinch test" to make sure the straps are tight enough. If you pinch fabric, it's too loose!</li> 
				<li> Make sure the chest clip is armpit level.</li>
				 <li> Rear facing until 2 is the current reccomendation. </li>
				<li> Don't buy those fancy add-ons because they are not safety tested with the car seat. </li>
</ul>
You can see my newborn above for the first time in her carseat. Something that is important to note is her neck strength.
As a newborn they can't lift their heads by themselves. So, a lof of parents feel the need to fix their
heads with add ons for the carseat. This is very unsafe. Babies heads turned sideways opens up the airways.
If you are correcting their head to be straight up and down there is more of a chance for babies head to fall 
forward closing those airways off.
